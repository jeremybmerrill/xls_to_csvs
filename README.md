XLS to CSVs
===========

Convert each sheet of an Excel spreadsheet into CSVs
----------------------------------------------------

````
./xls_to_csvs.py input_spreadsheet.xlsx
````

The output spreadsheets will be named with the name of the spreadsheet followed by the name of the sheet, e.g. `input_spreadsheet_Sheet1.csv`



Optionally, specify an output directory as the second CLI argument

````
./xls_to_csvs.py input_spreadsheet.xlsx output/
````
